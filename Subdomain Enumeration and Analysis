🌐 Wildcard DNS Misconfiguration & Subdomain Takeover

(Bug Bounty / Recon Notes)

🧩 1️⃣ Wildcard DNS Misconfiguration
🔍 What Is It?

A Wildcard DNS misconfiguration exists when a domain resolves any random or non-existent subdomain to an IP address or external service.

Example:
    anything.domain.com
    random123.domain.com
    test-xyz.domain.com


➡️ All of them still resolve.
👀 What to Look For

✅ Random or non-existent subdomains still resolve
✅ DNS returns an IP address or CNAME for any subdomain
✅ Presence of wildcard records like:
*.domain.com
✅ CNAME pointing to third-party services such as:
AWS
Azure
Netlify
Vercel
GitHub Pages

⚠️ Error pages indicating misconfiguration:
“No such app”
“Domain not configured”
“Unclaimed site”
🛠️ Useful Commands

Check whether random subdomains resolve:
dig random123.domain.com
nslookup test123.domain.com
dig test123.domain.com +short

👉 If any random name resolves, wildcard DNS may exist.

🏴‍☠️ 2️⃣ Subdomain Takeover

    ✅ What Is a Subdomain Takeover?
    A subdomain takeover occurs when:
    A subdomain points (via CNAME or A record) to a third-party service
    The resource on that service is deleted or unclaimed
    An attacker can claim the resource
    The attacker gains full control over the subdomain

🧭 Subdomain Takeover Methodology (Step-by-Step)

🔹 Step 1: Subdomain Enumeration
    Find all subdomains of the target.
    subfinder -d domain.com -all -silent
    🔧 Optional tools:
        amass
        assetfinder
        findomain

🔹 Step 2: Check Which Subdomains Are Alive
    Identify active subdomains.
    httpx -l subdomains.txt
    or 
    simple browser check.

🔹 Step 3: Identify DNS Records (🚨 CRITICAL STEP)
    This step decides whether takeover is even possible.
    dig sub.domain.com
    
    🔍 Look for CNAME pointing to:
        *.amazonaws.com
        *.azurewebsites.net
        *.herokuapp.com
        *.netlify.app
        *.vercel.app
        *.github.io
        *.zendesk.com

⚠️ Important Rule:

No CNAME = usually no classic subdomain takeover

🔹 Step 4: Automated Takeover Scanning
    Use tools to speed up detection.
    python3 takeover.py -l subdomains.txt
    or
    subjack -w subdomains.txt -ssl -t 50
    or
    nuclei -t takeover/

⚠️ Tools can give false positives.

🔹 Step 5: Manual Verification (🔥 MOST IMPORTANT)
    Always verify manually.
    Visit the subdomain in a browser and look for errors like:
        “No such app”
        “There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here”
        “Domain not found”
        “Project does not exist”

🔹 Step 6: Confirm Takeover Possibility (Safely)
    Check:
    ✅ Is the service claimable?
    ✅ Is the name available on that platform?
    
    ⚠️ Do NOT actually claim the resource unless the program explicitly allows it.
    
    📌 Summary Workflow
    
        Enumerate subdomains → Identify third-party CNAMEs → Verify unclaimed services manually → Confirm takeover feasibility → Report responsibly.

        blog.stylestry.com. 300 IN A 104.26.3.79

        🔍 Analysis:-
        These are A records, not CNAME
        The subdomain points directly to IP addresses
        IPs belong to Cloudflare
        🌐 External Third-Party Service?
        ❌ No (for takeover purposes)
        Cloudflare IPs are not claimable.
        💣 Is Subdomain Takeover Possible?
        ❌ NO — Not possible

        Check	Result
        CNAME present	❌ No
        External service	❌ No
        Unclaimed resource	❌ No
        Claimable by attacker	❌ No

➡️ This subdomain is NOT vulnerable to takeover

⚠️ Key Takeaway (Burn This Into Memory 🔥)

No CNAME = No classic subdomain takeover
