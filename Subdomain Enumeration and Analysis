1 Wildcard DNS Misconfiguration 
    What to Look For
    Random or non-existent subdomains still resolve
    DNS returns an IP or CNAME for any subdomain
    Presence of *.domain.com wildcard records
    CNAME pointing to third-party services (AWS, Azure, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
    Error pages like:
    “No such app”
    “Domain not configured”
    “Unclaimed site”

    command:- look for the ip and any records or answer
    dig random123.domain.com
    nslookup test123.domain.com
    dig test123.domain.com +short


2 domain takeover:- 
        ✅ What a Subdomain Takeover Is
        A subdomain takeover happens when:
        A subdomain points (CNAME/A) to a third-party service
        That service is unclaimed / deleted
        An attacker can claim it and control the subdomain
Step 1: Subdomain Enumeration
    subfinder -d domain.com -all -silent
    
    Optional tools:
        amass
        assetfinder
        findomain

step 2: Check Which Subdomains Are Alive
    httpx tool or http
    
Step 3: Identify CNAME / DNS Records (CRITICAL)
    This step decides if takeover is even possible.
    dig sub.domain.com
    
    Look for:
    CNAME pointing to:
    *.amazonaws.com
    *.azurewebsites.net
    *.herokuapp.com
    *.netlify.app
    *.vercel.app
    *.github.io
    *.zendesk.com
    ⚠️ No CNAME = usually no takeover
    
Step 4: Automated Takeover Scan
    python3 takeover.py -l subdomains.txt
    or
    subjack -w subdomains.txt -ssl -t 50
    or
    nuclei -t takeover/
    
Step 5: Manual Verification (MOST IMPORTANT)
    Never trust tools blindly.
    Visit the subdomain in browser and look for:
        “No such app”
        “There isn’t a GitHub Pages site here”
        “Domain not found”
        “Project does not exist”
        
Step 6: Confirm Takeover Possibility (Safely)
    Check:
        Can the service be claimed?
        Is the name available in that service dashboard?
        ⚠️ Do NOT actually claim unless program allows it.
Enumerate subdomains, identify third-party CNAMEs, verify unclaimed services manually, and confirm takeover feasibility before reporting.


Does the subdomain have a CNAME?:-
ex ouput 
    ANSWER SECTION:
    blog.stylestry.com. 300 IN A 172.67.75.96
    blog.stylestry.com. 300 IN A 104.26.2.79
    blog.stylestry.com. 300 IN A 104.26.3.79

👉 These are A records, not CNAME. blog.stylestry.com points directly to IP addresses, not to another domain.

Is it bound to an external third-party service? :-
    NO (for takeover purposes)

💣  Is Subdomain Takeover Possible? :_
❌ NO — Not possible
Why?
    Check	Result
    CNAME present	❌ No
    External service	❌ No
    Unclaimed resource	❌ No
    Claimable by attacker	❌ No
    ➡️ This subdomain is NOT vulnerable to takeover

⚠️ Key Takeaway (burn this into memory)
No CNAME = No classic subdomain takeover
