4 Wildcard DNS Misconfiguration 
    What to Look For
    Random or non-existent subdomains still resolve
    DNS returns an IP or CNAME for any subdomain
    Presence of *.domain.com wildcard records
    CNAME pointing to third-party services (AWS, Azure, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
    Error pages like:
    “No such app”
    “Domain not configured”
    “Unclaimed site”

    command:- look for the ip and any records or answer
    dig random123.domain.com
    nslookup test123.domain.com
    dig test123.domain.com +short
